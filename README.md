Experimental Plenty Systems Spree bindings
==========================================

After month of struggle with the Plenty Systems API I decided to stop using Plenty as a backend
for Spree. Since then, some interesting synchronisation code has been made and I'm releasing it
to whom it may concern.

Attention
=========

The code is highly experimental and the API will vary (as did in the past) and even break -
so probably you'll have to make changes to make it work.
